# Crowdfunding

These has been an exciting challenge for me, because we have used several tools that we have seen throughout the program, such as:

- Pandas
 - ETL
 - Pg Admin
 - SQL
 - Creating a DataFrame

## Our Deliverable 2 object is to transform and clean data, we needed to separate first and last name in two different columns.

Cleaning our data is an easier and clearer way to read our information.

### We made a new ERD and made a relationship diagram with different tables including our Backer table that we created in these challenge.

We added our backer's table in the Database with "ALTER TABLE"  statements, having a total of 5 tables in our challenge.
